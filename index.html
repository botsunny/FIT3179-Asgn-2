  <h1>15th MALAYSIAN GENERAL ELECTION</h1>
  <p id="intro">
    The 15th Malaysian General Election (GE15) was held on 19 November 2022.
    It was a rather unique one; a snap election held to resolve political
    instability that resulted in the first hung parliament in Malaysian history.
  </p>

  <p id="paragraph-text">
    While no party or coalition obtained a simple majority to form the federal
    government, the <span style="color: #d7282f;">Pakatan Harapan (PH)</span>
    coalition obtained the largest share of votes, and later allied with
    <span style="color: #000080;">Barisan Nasional (BN)</span> and other smaller
    coalitions to form a unity government.

        In recent years, Malaysia has seen a shift from a single-coalition dominance
        (<span style="color: #000080;">BN</span>) to a two-coalition
        battle, and in GE15, a three-cornered fight. High-income, densely populated
        <b>urban constituencies tend to prefer <span style="color:#d7282f;">PH</span></b>

        GE15 is the first election since the nation's voting age was lowered to
        18, sparking debate and discussion on which party the "youth wave" would
        benefit. Here is the <b>age distribution of the electorate based on gender</b>.
        <br><br><br>
        We can infer that for both genders, millenials and working adults aged
        <b>21-39</b> make up the majority of voters.

        That is all for the electorate. Now let us explore the candidates!
        GE15 saw 23 coalitions and parties contesting for the 222 federal seats
        of the Dewan Rakyat. To win a seat, a candidate only needs to obtain at
        least a plurality (ie. largest share) of votes in the corresponding constituency.
        <br><br>
        <b>How well and consistent has each coalition/party performed?</b>
        These boxplots show the <b>popular vote percentages</b> obtained by each
        coalition/party over their contested seats.
        <br><br>
        <b>Some parties have been
        excluded</b> due to low numbers that render them invisible in the plot.
        These are: <span style="color: #f5d801";>Parti Bersatu Rakyat Sabah</span>,
        <span style="color: #fbc625";>Parti Bumi Kenyalang</span>,

        <span style="color: #003152">PN</span> coalitions. Comparing their

        Despite GE15 resulting in a unity government led by <span style="color: #d7282f">PH</span>,
        which fielded the most female candidates, <b>female MPs were actually reduced

        Here is how the <b>final representation of ethnicities and genders in the
